# Battleship
Play Battleship against the computer!

The game allows the player to places their 5 ships on the board vertically or horizontally. 
The player is restricted from placing ships outside the bounds of the board or in such a way that ships overlap.
The player is given the option of replacing ships anywhere to prevent the game from proceeding with a mistake.

The computer generates its own board with the same ships, and the player and the computer take turns guessing where the opponents ships are placed.
The computer makes its guesses randomly, with no strategic placement of guesses.
To make up for this disadvantage, once the computer finds a ship, the next guesses are guaranteed to hit that ship until it sinks.
Once a player has no ships remaining, the game will conclude automatically.
